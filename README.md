# CNN for Movie Reviews Classification
This repository contains the code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie review dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we use a CNN architecture to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

## Dataset
The IMDb movie review dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for sentiment analysis tasks. It consists of 50,000 movie reviews, split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative.

## Code Generation
The codes and explanations in this project were generated using different prompts from OpenAI's ChatGPT. This approach was used to automate the process of writing code and explanations, saving time and effort in documentation.
