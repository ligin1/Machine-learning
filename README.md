## ML_CNN.ipynb - How to use CNN for Movie Reviews Classification
* This notebook contains the code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie review dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

* Introduction - Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we use a CNN architecture to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

* Dataset - The IMDb movie review dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for sentiment analysis tasks. It consists of 50,000 movie reviews, split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative.

* Code Generation - The codes and explanations in this project were generated using different prompts from OpenAI's ChatGPT. 

* Environment setup - conda create --name ML python=3.9 tensorflow jupyterlab
